## 🔎 About
Senior practitioner in **Artificial Intelligence**, **MLOps**, and **Data Engineering**. I design and ship systems that are:

- **Reproducible:** deterministic seeds, `pyproject.toml`, Docker/Makefile, versioned data & models.
- **Observable:** model/infra metrics, drift checks, latency & cost budgets.
- **Automated:** tests + CI/CD with GitHub Actions, clear release hygiene.
- **Pragmatic:** SOTA only when it serves measurable outcomes.

**Modeling:** Computer Vision (ResNet, ViT, YOLO), NLP (Transformers), Tabular (GBMs).  
**Ops:** MLflow/DVC, Airflow/Kedro, GitHub Actions, Docker.  
**Data:** Polars/Pandas, DuckDB/Spark, dbt, production-grade SQL.  
**Apps:** FastAPI, Streamlit.

## 🐢 About (deliberate pace)
I build machine-learning systems the way critical infrastructure is built: slowly, deliberately, and with respect for constraints. I start by clarifying the objective and the failure modes, then map the data lineage—where information comes from, how it changes, and what it costs to move and store. From there, I design experiments that are easy to reproduce and even easier to retire when they no longer serve the goal.

Most of my modeling work lives in **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**, with **scikit-learn** for strong baselines and **ONNX** when portability matters. I track experiments and artifacts with **MLflow** and **DVC**, orchestrate with **Airflow**, and wire outcomes into reliable services using **FastAPI** and containerized deploys. Data is treated like product: schemas are versioned, quality is monitored, and transformations are tested (dbt, Spark/Polars) before they reach downstream consumers.

I value observability over optimism. Models ship with metrics that explain their behavior, budgets that cap their latency and cost, and drift checks that surface when reality changes. CI ensures code, data, and docs evolve together; conventional commits keep the conversation precise. I don’t chase state-of-the-art for its own sake—I chase dependable outcomes that compound over time.
