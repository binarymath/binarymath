## 🔎 About
AI practitioner with a focus on **MLOps** and **Data Engineering**. I ship solutions from **experiment to deploy**: pipeline design, data/model versioning, automated tests, observability, and **production SLAs**.

- **Modeling:** Computer Vision (ResNet/ViT/YOLO), NLP (transformers), tabular (GBMs).
- **MLOps:** DVC/MLflow, Airflow/Kedro, GitHub Actions, Docker, drift monitoring.
- **Data:** Ingestion & orchestration, Spark/Polars, dbt, production-grade SQL.
- **APIs & Apps:** FastAPI/Streamlit, packaging, CI/CD, reproducible infra.

## 📈 How I Work
- **Full reproducibility:** seeds, `pyproject.toml`, Docker/Makefile, versioned data.
- **Automated quality:** `pre-commit`, linting, typing, tests (pytest), CI/CD.
- **Observability:** model metrics, drift, latency, and cost tracking.
- **Useful docs:** clear README, **MODEL_CARD.md** and **DATA_CARD.md** when applicable.
- **Collaboration:** Conventional Commits, small PRs, objective reviews.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
1. Open an issue with context and proposal.  
2. Create a branch using Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`…).  
3. Include tests and doc updates when needed.  
4. Open a small, focused PR.
